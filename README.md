# dedupe

**dedupe** is a Python tool for merging, cleaning, and normalizing subdomain lists.  
It removes duplicates, supports optional IP-based collapsing, and can probe for live hosts — making it a useful utility for bug bounty recon workflows.

## ⚠️ Development Status

**dedupe is fully functional and already speeds up recon workflows,**  
but it’s still under active development. Expect ongoing improvements, new features, and refinements.  

👉 Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are always welcome!

## ✨ Features
- Merge multiple `.txt` files into a single deduplicated list  
- Normalize hostnames (removes trailing dots, converts to lowercase, etc.)  
- Optional: Collapse by resolved IP (`--collapse-by-ip`)  
- Optional: Probe with [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx) (`--probe`) and save live results  
- Clean output structure:  
  - `merged_subs.txt` → deduplicated hosts  
  - `ip_map.csv` → host-to-IP mappings (if collapse enabled)  
  - `live_hosts.txt` → responsive hosts (if probe enabled)
